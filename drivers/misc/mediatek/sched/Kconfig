	  Scheduler optimizations for heterogeneous platforms.
	  Attempts to introspectively select task affinity to optimize power
	  and performance. Basic support for multiple (>2) cpu types is in place,
	  but it has only been tested with two types of cpus.
	  There is currently no support for migration of task groups, hence

config SCHED_HMP_PRIO_FILTER

	  Enables task priority based HMP migration filter. Any task with

	help
	  Scales the current load contribution in line with the frequency
	  of the CPU that the task was executed on.
	  In this version, we use a simple linear scale derived from the
	  maximum frequency reported by CPUFreq.
	  Restricting tracked load to be scaled by the CPU's frequency
	  represents the consumption of possible compute capacity
	  (rather than consumption of actual instantaneous capacity as
	  normal) and allows the HMP migration's simple threshold
	  migration strategy to interact more predictably with CPUFreq's
	  asynchronous compute capacity changes.
